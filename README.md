# Gasless Experience

This project aims to create a gasless experience for users, based on the Circle Developer Bounty.

## Core Technology

*   **Circle Programmable Wallets:** This will be used to create and manage user wallets.
*   **Circle Gas Station:** This service will be used to sponsor gas fees for users.

## Development Plan

1.  **Set up Programmable Wallets:** Create Smart Contract Account (SCA) wallets for users.
2.  **Configure Gas Station:** Set up policies in the developer console to control which transactions are sponsored.
3.  **Initiate gasless transactions:** Develop the application logic to initiate transactions that will be sponsored by the Gas Station.
4.  **Test the gasless flow:** Test the entire process to ensure that users can make transactions without paying for gas.
